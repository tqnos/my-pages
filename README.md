# About me

Hello, my name is Thanh Duong, and I live in Sammamish! My birthday is on the first day of spring!  I do algebra at AOPS and I'm currently learning to write code with my dad and brother. I'm the asb treasurer of my school.

Hobbies!
* Gaming
     * Valorant
     * Moomoo.io
     * Minecraft
* Sports
     * Soccer
     * Tennis
 
Goals from coding

* I want to be able to create a game site on github so I could sell the websites at school to other kids so that they can play games
* I want to be able to build and design websites to help me in my computer science career


Tips to survive middle school

* Do well in 6th grade math and take algebra in 7th grade
* Make sure you have a big friend group so you always have protection
* Have a few close friends, it helps a lot
* In group projects, never pick people you don't trust or people who you know won't work
* Try to do all your homework in school, that way you can have fun after school rather than study more
* Don't be the quiet kid but don't be the extremely loud kid
* If you're trying out for sports, make sure you be kind to the coach because it helps
* If you have a bad teacher, just do all your work and don't talk much
* If you have a good teacher, build a relationship with them
* Don't play games during class, play during lunch since the admin don't really care if you're playing games or not and will often come up to you and watch you play, plus since so many kids play games during lunch, it would be harder to single you out
* **IMPORTANT** Do not, DO NOT, mess with 8th graders when in 6th or 7th grade, it can get scary



Here is my puppy, prue. She's a labrador retriever mixed with pit bull.
